# Build 🏗️

Run the repository and complete the following:

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #1 — Building and serving your LangGraph Agent Graph
  - Task 1: Getting Dependencies & Environment
    - Configure `.env` (OpenAI, Tavily, optional LangSmith)
  - Task 2: Serve the Graph Locally
    - `uv run langgraph dev` (API on http://localhost:2024)
  - Task 3: Call the API
    - `uv run test_served_graph.py` (sync SDK example)
  - Task 4: Explore assistants (from `langgraph.json`)
    - `agent` → `simple_agent` (tool-using agent)
    - `agent_helpful` → `agent_with_helpfulness` (separate helpfulness node)

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #2 — Using LangGraph Studio to visualize the graph
  - Task 1: Open Studio while the server is running
    - https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:2024
  - Task 2: Visualize & Stream
    - Start a run and observe node-by-node updates
  - Task 3: Compare Flows
    - Contrast `agent` vs `agent_helpful` (tool calls vs helpfulness decision)

<details>
<summary>🚧 Advanced Build 🚧 (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

- Create and deploy a locally hosted MCP server with FastMCP.
- Extend your tools in `tools.py` to allow your LangGraph to consume the MCP Server.
</details>

# Ship 🚢

- Running local server (`langgraph dev`)
- Short demo showing both assistants responding

# Share 🚀
- Walk through your graph in Studio
- Share 3 lessons learned and 3 lessons not learned


#### ❓ Question:

What is the purpose of the `chunk_overlap` parameter when using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to prepare documents for RAG, and what trade-offs arise as you increase or decrease its value?

##### ✅ Answer:
Purpose of chunk_overlap: To carry a slice of text from the end of one chunk into the start of the next, preserving context that spans chunk boundaries so the retriever can capture cross-boundary facts.

Increase overlap
Pros: Better context continuity, fewer “cut-off” facts, improved recall and answer quality.
Cons: More (and more redundant) chunks, higher embedding/storage cost, longer indexing/query times, potential precision drop due to duplicate matches.

If you decrease overlap
Pros: Fewer chunks → cheaper and faster indexing/retrieval.
Cons: Higher risk of missing boundary context, worse recall on facts split across chunks.

#### ❓ Question:

Your retriever is configured with `search_kwargs={"k": 5}`. How would adjusting `k` likely affect RAGAS metrics such as Context Precision and Context Recall in practice, and why?

##### ✅ Answer:
Increasing k raises Context Recall because retrieving more chunks increases the probability that the gold/supporting evidence is included; but it typically lowers Context Precision since the larger set brings in more irrelevant text, diluting the proportion of relevant context and adding noise for the LLM. Decreasing k has the opposite effect: fewer chunks reduce noise so a higher share of the retrieved context is relevant (precision up), but with fewer candidates the chance of missing necessary evidence increases (recall down). Choose a moderate k via evaluation, or pair a higher k with re-ranking/filters to keep precision high.

#### ❓ Question:

Compare the `agent` and `agent_helpful` assistants defined in `langgraph.json`. Where does the helpfulness evaluator fit in the graph, and under what condition should execution route back to the agent vs. terminate?

##### ✅ Answer:
The agent assistant (simple_agent) runs the model and, if the last AI message contains tool_calls, routes to the action tool node; otherwise it terminates. The agent_helpful assistant (agent_with_helpfulness) inserts a post-response helpfulness node after the agent whenever there are no pending tool_calls: the evaluator returns HELPFULNESS:Y to terminate, HELPFULNESS:N to route back to the agent for another attempt, and HELPFULNESS:END to stop via a loop guard when len(messages) > 10. Tool use still loops action → agent as in the simple agent.
